Whether it's cricket, or football, do you wish to have the highlights from a match you missed or favourite matches ready at your convenience? Generate them with ease with this project! :smile:

This project enables to derive highlights from the complete match recording, and the best part about it is that it doesn't warrant any knowledge of *computer vision and NLP!* Sounds amazing, isn't it? 

While we may perceive the creation of these videos to be a domain of advanced technologies such as deep learning, what if we could do it without that, instead by implementing simple concepts of energy threshold in sound waves and still manage to get a decent highlight reel? :grin:

The key motivation behind this project was to familiarize myself with video and audio processing libraries in Python3.6.
